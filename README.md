	1. CREATE A DYNAMO TABLE

	2. CREATE AN IAM ROLE - for the lambda to use

	3. CREATE LAMBDA FOR THE API

	4. CREATE AN API GATEWAY TO ACT AS A FRONT DOOR

	5. GO BACK TO YOUR LAMBDA FUNCTION TO DEPLOY SOME DUMMY RETURN OBJECT

	6. TEST DUMMY API ON POSTMAN - 200 SHOULD BE RETURNED

	7. SINCE THE API CAN BE ACCESSIBLE BY ANYONE, LETS CONFIGURE API GATEWAY TO REQUIRE A KEY
